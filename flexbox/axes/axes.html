            Flexbox can work horizontally or vertically, but some rules change depending on the orientation
            we are working in. The default direction for flex container is horizontal, <code>row</code>, but 
            it can be changed to vertical, <code>column</code>. The declaration wil look like this:
        </p>
        <p>
            <pre>
                CSS
                <code>
                    .flex-container {
                        flex-direction: column;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of your containers as having two axes: the main axis and the cross axis. Direction of the axes 
            change as a resulting effect when <code>flex-direction</code> changes. In most use cases, <code>flex-direction: row</code>
            puts the main axis horizontal (left to right), and <code>column</code> puts the main axis vertical (top to bottom).
        </p>
        <p>
            In our first example from <a href="../intro/i-t-f.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intro to Flexbox</a>, 
            our parent &lt;div&gt; was given the <code>display: flex</code> property and the items were then arranged 
            horizontally. <strong>Default setting for flex direction is <code>flex-direction: row</code></strong>. 
            In <a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/BaZKPdw" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">this example</a>, 
            if we apply the property <code>flex-direction: column</code> instead, the items will stack vertically.
        </p>
        <!-- Set the link in above to CodePen as HTML/CSS/JavaScript Editor with a Preview -->
         <p>
            From this example, <code>flex-direction: column</code> will not work if the shorthand <code>flex: 1</code> 
            was used. Remember, <code>flex: 1</code> is shorthand for <code>flex: 1 1 0</code>. From this, the 
            flex-basis states the initial size of an item, which is defined as "0" in this scenario meaning to "grow" from nothing. 
            Empty &lt;div&gt;s, by default, have 0 height. With a lack of content or "room to grow", the items remain empty, 
            giving the appearance of the borders only. Even with a declared property of <code>height: 80px</code>, our 
            flex-basis property still tells us to start from 0. Our <code>height: 80px</code> instead then behaves as a height 
            limiter.
            <br>
            <ul>
                Summary for <code>flex: 1</code> and why it doesn't work.
                <!-- When using "flex: 1", it does not obey our height declaration, "height: 80px", to start from there. Rather it 
                 ignores it and interprets it as a height limiter. As a result, with no height, our items do not "grow" to "fill" 
                 our container. -->
                <li>
                    <code>flex: 1</code> stands for <code>flex-grow: 1</code>, <code>flex-shrink: 1</code>, <code>flex-basis: 0</code>. 
                    <code>flex-basis: 0</code> says the initial size of the item starts at 0.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Height declarations will be ignored in favor of <code>flex-basis</code> when using <code>flex-basis: 0</code>.Any 
                    declared <code>height</code>s will not be used as a starting point, but act as a height limiter. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Empty &lt;div&gt;s have a height of 0 by default. With no content to fill the item, only borders remain visible.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Summary for <code>flex: 1 1 auto</code>.
                <!-- When using "flex: 1 1 auto", our flex-basis states "start growing from where you have been told or from nothing". 
                 Since we declared "height: 80px", flexbox sets the items at a height of 80px each right from the start. This "stretches" 
                 or "fills" our items and gives them the appearance of boxes stacked on top of another. -->
                <li>
                    <code>flex: 1 1 0</code> stands for <code>flex-grow: 1</code>, <code>flex-shrink: 1</code>, <code>flex-basis: auto</code>. 
                    <code>flex-basis: auto</code> means "Start from where you have been told or from nothing".
                </li>
                <li>
                    With <code>height: 80px</code> declared, flex-basis' initial size starts at 80px.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With our &lt;div&gt;s being told by <code>flex-basis: auto</code> to start growing at our declared <code>height: 80px</code>, 
                    our items appear "filled" or "stretched" as boxes stacked on top another.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Alternatively, another option is to achieve a similar result is to apply a <code>height</code> on the 
            parent container or to use <code>flex-grow: 1</code> instead.
         </p>
         <p>
            Note: When changing the <code>flex-direction</code> to <code>column</code>, the <code>flex-basis</code> 
            refers to height instead of width (use the visual in the example above).
         </p>
         <p>
            Default behaviour is <code>flex-direction: row</code> which arranges things horizontally. This often functions 
            nicely without changing other details in CSS is because block-level elements default to the full width of the parent. 
            Changing things to vertical with <code>flex-direction: column</code> adds complexity. Block-level elements default to 
            the height of their content, and in this case, there is no content.

            Questions
         </h4>
         <p class="question">
            How do you make flex items arrange themselves vertically instead of horizontally?
         </p>
         <p class="answer">
            By applying the declaration <code>flex-direction: column</code> to the flex container.
         </p>
         <p class="question">
            In a <code>column</code> flex-container, what does <code>flex-basis</code> refer to?
         </p>
         <p class="answer">
            <code>height</code>.
         </p>
         <p class="question">
            In a <code>row</code> flex-container, what does the <code>flex-basis</code> refer to?
         </p>
         <p class="answer">
            <code>width</code>.
         </p>
         <p class="question">
            Why do the previous two questions have different answers?
         </p>
         <div class="answer">
            They have different answers because of the direction of the content is arranged. Flexbox 
            lays out items along a main axis, which is defined by the <code>flex-direction</code>.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In a <code>row</code> direction, the main axis is horizontal, so <code>flex-basis</code> controls <code>width</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a <code>column</code> direction, the main axis is vertical, so <code>flex-basis</code> controls <code>height</code>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <code>flex-basis</code> always defines the <b>initial size of a flex item along the main axis</b>, which 
            is why it refers to different physical properties depending on the layout direction.
