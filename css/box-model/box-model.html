        <h1>The Box Model</h1>
        <p>
            The simplest way to structure a webpage is to envision all the elements on the page as a set of building
            blocks. The simplest shape for us to understand is a rectangular box. You can have one surrounding 
            another, be surrounded by one, next another, or even all three at the same time. Let's use the example below:
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS
        </p>
        <pre><code>
            * &#10100
                outline: 2px solid red;
            &#10101
        </code></pre>
        <img src="./images/boxes.png" alt="Image of Box Model with elements in boxes, next to, above/below, etc.">
        <p>
            Here we have an image with some content written in HTML, each element surrounded with a 2px solid red 
            line in the shape of a box. When structuring your webpage, each piece of content gets shaped into a 
            rectangular box. When building your webpage, all you are doing is deciding how to lay out all these boxes.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many methods to size the boxes to your desire, including the space between each of them. This 
            is done by adding the &ltpadding&gt, &ltborder&gt, and &ltmargin&gt properties to the declaration. To summarize:
            <dl>
                <dt>Padding</dt>
                <dd>Defines the space between the border of the box and the content.</dd>
                <dt>Border</dt>>
                <dd>Defines the space between the border and the the margin.</dd>
                <dt>Margin</dt>
                <dd>Defines the space between the margin and adjacent margins of other boxes.</dd>
            </dl>
        </p>

        <p>
            <dl>Box Model Properties
                <dt>"height:"</dt>
                <dd>Defines the vertical space of the content box, not including the padding.</dd>
                <dt>"width:"</dt>
                <dd>Defines the horizontal space of the content box, not including the padding.</dd>
            </dl>
            <ul>
                <li>Margins between boxes collapse (share) with each other, but the size will be determined by the larger value.</li>
                <li>
                    When using the property "box-sizing: border-box", it sets the determined width and height values to be 
                    the hard limit. This limit will include the content, padding, and border and will never be surpassed. 
                    What happens instead is the content box's size gets reduced instead by our padding and border sizes.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            <dl>Properties
                <dt>"box-sizing: content-box"</dt>
                <dd>Works exactly like "border-box", except the limits only go up the the content box. The values on padding 
                    border are not included in content-box.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            Note: There is no margin-box because margin is not really part of the element itself. Margin is more about the 
            space between adjacent boxes.

        <ul>
            <li>
                The box-sizing property in CSS defines how the total size of an element's box is calculated. 
                It can be set to either "content-box" or "border-box".
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                By using "content-box" (the default), the values of "width" and "height" only apply to the 
                content itself &#8211 padding and border values are added outside of those dimensions.
            </li>
            <li>
                By using "border-box", the values of "width" and "height" include the content, padding, and 
                border &#8211 this means the sum of those values are equal to the "width" and "height" values.
            </li>
