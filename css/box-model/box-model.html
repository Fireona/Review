        <h1>The Box Model</h1>
        <p>
            The simplest way to structure a webpage is to envision all the elements on the page as a set of building
            blocks. The simplest shape for us to understand is a rectangular box. You can have one surrounding 
            another, be surrounded by one, next another, or even all three at the same time. Let's use the example below:
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS
        </p>
        <pre><code>
            * &#10100
                outline: 2px solid red;
            &#10101
        </code></pre>
        <img src="./images/boxes.png" alt="Image of Box Model with elements in boxes, next to, above/below, etc.">
        <p>
            Here we have an image with some content written in HTML, each element surrounded with a 2px solid red 
            line in the shape of a box. When structuring your webpage, each piece of content gets shaped into a 
            rectangular box. When building your webpage, all you are doing is deciding how to lay out all these boxes.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many methods to size the boxes to your desire, including the space between each of them. This 
            is done by adding the &ltpadding&gt, &ltborder&gt, and &ltmargin&gt properties to the declaration. To summarize:
            <dl>
                <dt>Padding</dt>
                <dd>Defines the space between the border of the box and the content.</dd>
                <dt>Border</dt>>
                <dd>Defines the space between the border and the the margin.</dd>
                <dt>Margin</dt>
                <dd>Defines the space between the margin and adjacent margins of other boxes.</dd>
            </dl>
        </p>

                <li>
                    When using the property "box-sizing: border-box", it sets the determined width and height values to be 
                    the hard limit. This limit will include the content, padding, and border and will never be surpassed. 
                    What happens instead is the content box's size gets reduced instead by our padding and border sizes.
                </li>

                <dt>"box-sizing: content-box"</dt>
                <dd>Works exactly like "border-box", except the limits only go up the the content box. The values on padding 
                    border are not included in content-box.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            Note: There is no margin-box because margin is not really part of the element itself. Margin is more about the 
            space between adjacent boxes.

                The box-sizing property in CSS defines how the total size of an element's box is calculated. 
                It can be set to either "content-box" or "border-box".
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                By using "content-box" (the default), the values of "width" and "height" only apply to the 
                content itself &#8211 padding and border values are added outside of those dimensions.
            </li>
            <li>
                By using "border-box", the values of "width" and "height" include the content, padding, and 
                border &#8211 this means the sum of those values are equal to the "width" and "height" values.

        <h4>Notes</h4>
            <p>
                The <code>margin</code> property defines the outermost property of the box model which creates the space around an element.
            </p>
            <p>
                Margins are set using lengths, percentages, or the keyword <code>auto</code>, and even negative values.
                <pre><code>
                    .box {
                        margin: 0 3em 0 3em;
                    }
                </code></pre>                
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>margin</code> is a shorthand property and accepts up to four values:
                <pre><code>
                    .box {
                        margin: &ltmargin-top&gt &ltmargin-right&gt &ltmargin-bottom&gt &ltmargin-left&gt
                    }
                </code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                Each of the <code>margin</code> tags are to have values of some numerical value, percentage, or auto. They are each separated by a single space.
            </p>
            <p>
                If fewer than four values are defined, the missing values are assumed based on what values are provided. 
                In the example below, the declarations are written differently but both will give the same results: 
                <pre><code>
                    .box {
                        margin: 0 1.5em;
                    }

                    .box {
                        margin: 0 1.5em 0 1.5em;
                    }
                </code></pre>
                In the first declaration, the values are defined for &lttop-and-bottom&gt and &ltleft-and-right&gt.
            </p>
            <h4><code>auto</code> and Centering</h4>
            <p>
                <code>auto</code> tells the browser to define the margin for you. In most cases, the value of 
                <code>auto</code> will be the equivalent to a value of 0 (the initial value for each margin property) 
                or else whatever space is available on that side of the element. However, auto is useful for horizontal 
                centering:
                <pre><code>
                    .container {
                        width: 980px;
                        margin: 0 auto;
                    }
                </code></pre>
                In this scenario, two things occur to center this element horizontally within the given space:
                <ul>
                    <li>The element is given a specified width.</li>
                    <li>Left and right margins are set to auto.</li>
                </ul>
                Without a defined value for the width, <code>auto</code> will have little to no effect. The reason 
                is <code>width</code> determines how "wide" your element is. Without a value to it, your element will
                automatically take up the entire space, and leave nothing for your margin (because your element does not 
                include margin). Once a <code>width</code> value is defined, that value is subtracted from the total 
                space available and what remains becomes your margin. This allows the <code>auto</code> value to 
                function and center elements.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You can't use <code>margin: auto</code> to center elements vertically by default, because the vertical 
                        space in most web layouts is undefined — web pages grow down naturally with content. For vertical 
                        centering with auto to work, the element must be inside a parent container with a defined <code>height</code>. 
                        Without that constraint, the browser has no vertical space to divide, so auto margins can’t be calculated.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        P.S: It took over two hours trying to understand this. This is how I feel now:
                        <br>
                        <img src="./images/melt.gif" alt="Animated slime melting">
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Collapsing Margins</h4>
            <p>
                Vertical margins on different elements that touch each other will collapse (overlap). This creates a 
                single margin giving the appearance of whichever margin holds the greater value. This only applies to 
                vertical margins.
                HTML
                <pre><code>
                    &lth2&gtCollapsing Margins&lt/h2&gt
                </code></pre>
                CSS
                <pre><code>
                    h2 {
                        margin: 0 0 20px 0;                    
                    }

                    p {
                        margin: 10px 0 0 0;
                    }
                </code></pre>
                Here we have a scenario where &lth2&gt element has a bottom margin of 20px while our &ltp&gt element 
                has a top margin of 10px. When the two margins collapse with each other, only the greater value stands 
                as the margin, that being 20px.
            </p>
            <p>    
                Collapsing may seem unintuitive at first glance, but it is useful. This prevents empty elements from 
                adding extra (usually unwanted) vertical margin space. It also gives way to only have to adjust one margin 
                on a single element. If they did not collapse, we would have to adjust two margins on two elements to 
                maintain consistent spacing. Lastly, collapsing of margins also applies to nested elements as well.
                <br>
                HTML
                <pre><code>
                    &lth2&gtCollapsing Marings&lth2&lt/h2&gt
                    &ltdiv&gt&ltp&gtExample text.&lt/p&gt&lt/div&gt
                </code></pre>
                CSS
                <pre><code>
                    h2 {
                        margin: 0 0 20px 0;
                    }

                    div {
                        margin-top: 40px
                    }

                    p {
                        margin-top: 30px
                    }
                </code></pre>
                Here we have a <code>&ltp&gt</code> with a top margin of 30px nested within a <code>&ltdiv&gt</code> element that 
                has a top margin of 40px. We also have an <code>&lth2&gt</code> element with a bottom margin of 20px. If 
                margins did not collapse, we would be looking at a margin of 90px. However, because they do, there is no 
                need to adjust the top margins to remove unneccessary vertical space.
            </p>
            <h4>Negative Margins</h4>
            <p>
                When interacting with other elements, positive margins push other elements away. Likewise, a negative margin 
                will pull them closer to it.
            </p>
