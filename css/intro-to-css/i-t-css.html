        <h1>Syntax</h1>
        <p>CSS are made of rules composed of selectors, a property-value pair, with a semicolon to separate the declarations of the property-value pair.</p>
        <img src="./images/syntax-example.jpg" alt="CSS Syntax Diagram labelling selectors, properties and values">        
        <p>With a selector chosen, you begin designating the property to change. In order to do so, we use "&#10100". 
            This is the beginning of our "declaration", which is made up of a list property-value pair(s).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Properties are the characteristics to style the selectors with. After the property has been chosen,
             we follow up with a colon to designate value to the property and end with a semicolon. 
             This will end the declaration and apply it to the chosen selectors. We begin the next line if we have any more styles to apply, 
             if not then end the declaration with "&#10101".</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Selectors</h2>
        <p>Selectors are as implied. They only "select" HTML elements to apply CSS rules to.</p>
        <h4>Universal Selector</h4>
        <p>The universal selector is designated with an asterisk. Usage of the universal selector applies to elements of every type, meaning the entire document.</p>
