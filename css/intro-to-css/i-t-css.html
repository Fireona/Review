        <h1>Syntax</h1>
        <p>CSS are made of rules composed of selectors, a property-value pair, with a semicolon to separate the declarations of the property-value pair.</p>
        <img src="./images/syntax-example.jpg" alt="CSS Syntax Diagram labelling selectors, properties and values">        
        <p>With a selector chosen, you begin designating the property to change. In order to do so, we use "&#10100". 
            This is the beginning of our "declaration", which is made up of a list property-value pair(s).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Properties are the characteristics to style the selectors with. After the property has been chosen,
             we follow up with a colon to designate value to the property and end with a semicolon. 
             This will end the declaration and apply it to the chosen selectors. We begin the next line if we have any more styles to apply, 
             if not then end the declaration with "&#10101".</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Selectors</h2>
        <p>Selectors are as implied. They only "select" HTML elements to apply CSS rules to.</p>
        <h4>Universal Selector</h4>
        <p>The universal selector is designated with an asterisk. Usage of the universal selector applies to elements of every type, meaning the entire document.</p>
        <p>* &#10100
            <br>
                color: purple;
            <br>
            &#10101
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Type Selectors</h4>
        <p>Type selectors will select all elements of a given element type. The syntax is simply the name of the element.</p>
        <p>p &#10100
            <br>
            color: purple;
            <br>
            &#10101
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Class Selectors</h4>
        <p>Class selectors are a way of selecting particular type selectors of a given attribute name. This is done by adding in a class attribute to the HTML element.</p>
        <p>HTML DOC
            <br>
            &ltp class="blue"&gt This is a blue paragraph.
            <br>
            &ltp class="blue"&gt This is also a blue paragraph.
            <br>
            &ltdiv class="red"&gt This is a red paragraph.</p>
            <p>CSS
            <br>
                .blue &#10100
                <br>
                color: blue;
                <br>
                &#10101
        </p>
        In this scenario, class selectors are designated with a period preceding the class selector.</p>
        <h4>ID Selectors</h4>
        <p>ID Selectors are similar to class selectors. They select elements with the given ID, another attribute placed in an HTML element. 
            The only caveat is each element can only have one ID. It cannot be repeated on a single page and should not have any whitespace.</p>
        <p> HTML DOC
            <br>
            &ltp class="blue"&gt This is a blue paragraph.
            <br>
            &ltp class="blue"&gt This is also a blue paragraph.
            <br>
            &ltdiv id="red"&gt This is a red div.
            <br>
            &ltp class="red"&gt This is a blue paragraph.
        </p>

        <p>CSS
                <br>
                #red &#10100
                <br>
                color: red;
                <br>
                &#10101
                <br>
        </p>
        <p>In this example, the ID selector is designated with a hashtag preceding the ID selector name.</p>
