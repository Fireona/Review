        <h4>Block vs Inline</h4>
        <p>
            Most elements we've used so far are block elements, or another way of saying it is their default style 
            is set to "<code>display: block</code>". By default, all block elements will appear on the page stacked 
            on top of each other. Every new block element will create a new line.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the contrary, inline elements do not create a new line, but appear in line with the elements they are 
            placed next to. A good example would be a link (from using the <code>&lta&gt</code> tags) that is part of a 
            text content. For example:
        </p>
        <p>
           Blah blah blah <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyMXYE_50Ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blah blah blah</a> blah blah.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As you can see that even though there is a link inside, the line of text is sitting inside as part of 
            the content. Also, the padding and margin properties work differently on inline elements, so make it an 
            effort to not appyl any extra padding or margin on such elements.
        </p>
        <h4>The Middle Ground: Inline Block</h4>
        <p>
            Inline-block elements behave like inline elements, but have block-style padding and margin. 
            <code>display: in-line block</code> is a useful tool to know about, but generally is overseen by 
            Flexbox when aligning boxes (covered next lesson).
        </p>
        
        <h4>Divs and Spans</h4>
        <p>
            <code>div</code> and <code>span</code> elements give no meaning to the content, but are generic boxes 
            that can contain anything. Due to this particular nature, that is what makes both of these elements 
            so widely useful. This allows us to easily plant IDs or classes on them making them easily targettable
            with CSS. It also allows us to group related elements under a common parent element so we can easily 
            position them on a page.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>div</code> is a block element by default. It is mostly used to as a container element to group other 
            elements. It allows us to divide the page into different blocks and apply styling to said blocks.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <code>span</code> is an inline-level element by default. It can be used to group text content and other inline 
            HTML elements for styling. This should only be used when no other semantic HTML element is appropriate.
