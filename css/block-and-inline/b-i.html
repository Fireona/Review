        <h4>Block vs Inline</h4>
        <p>
            Most elements we've used so far are block elements, or another way of saying it is their default style 
            is set to "<code>display: block</code>". By default, all block elements will appear on the page stacked 
            on top of each other. Every new block element will create a new line.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the contrary, inline elements do not create a new line, but appear in line with the elements they are 
            placed next to. A good example would be a link (from using the <code>&lta&gt</code> tags) that is part of a 
            text content. For example:
        </p>
        <p>
           Blah blah blah <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyMXYE_50Ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blah blah blah</a> blah blah.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As you can see that even though there is a link inside, the line of text is sitting inside as part of the content.
