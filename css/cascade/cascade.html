        <h1>
            Cascade of CSS
        </h1>
        <p>
            When applying CSS to HTML, we often have rules that conflict with one another. This brings interesting 
            results that could be undesired. CSS only applies rules the way we tell it to, with the exception 
            of defeault styles that vary from every browser. This can make certain elements look different between 
            browsers, even if we tell CSS how to style them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Results like such are usually due to differences in default styles between browsers, not understanding 
            exactly what it is we have told it to do, not knowing what something does, or how something called 
            the cascade works.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cascade is what determines which rules get applied to HTML, and there are different number of
            components that make the cascade function the way it does.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Specificity
        </h2>
        <p>
            Any CSS declaration with greater specificity will take priority over any preceding declaration 
            with less specificity. Inline styles have the highest level of specificity over selectors, regardless
            of how many selectors are used. Meanwhile, there are rules that selectors use that determine their
            level of specificity. From what we have learned, it priority from highest to lowest goes as is:
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                ID Selectors (Or inline style)
            </li>
            <li>
                Class Selectors
            </li>
            <li>
                Type Selectors
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Specificity only takes place when more than one declaration of the same property is being applied
            to an element. This acts as a decisive marker. Any ID selector will always succeed any number of
            class selectors, and likewise class selectors will always precede any number of type selectors. If 
            there are no difference in levels of specificity, the one with more selectors of the same type will 
            come out on top.
            <pre>
                HTML
                <code>
                    &lt;div class="main"&gt;
                        &lt;div class="list subsection"&gt;Red text&lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre>
                CSS
                <code>
                    /* rule 1 */
                    .subsection {
                        color: blue;
                    }
            
                    /* rule 2 */
                    .main .list {
                        color: red;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the example above, we see two declarations. Both are using the class selector. However, 
            rule two has more class selectors used. This makes it more "specific" and will take precedence 
            over rule one, make the text red.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another example:
            <pre>
                HTML
                <code>
                    &lt;div class="main"&gt;
                        &lt;div class="list" id="subsection"&gt;Blue text&lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt; 
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre>
                CSS
                <code>
                    /* rule 1 */
                    #subsection {
                        color: blue;
                    }
            
                    /* rule 2 */
                    .main .list {
                        color: red;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Over here, we see that both have their own class selectors, &lt;main&gt; and &lt;list&gt;. As we continue
            to look in the lines, there's also an ID Selector here as well, the ID &lt;subsection&gt;. In accordance 
            to the casacde, rule two will apply and make the text color blue because ID selectors have the highest 
            level of specificity.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a more difficult example:
            <pre>
                HTML
                <code>
                    &lt;div class="main"&gt;
                        &lt;div class="list" id="subsection"&gt;Red text on yellow background&lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre>
                CSS
                <code>
                    /* rule 1 */
                    #subsection {
                        background-color: yellow;
                        color: blue;
                    }
            
                    /* rule 2 */
                    .main #subsection {
                        color: red;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            In this case, we see that both rules have the ID selector used for the ID &lt;subsection&gt;. If we
            look a bit closer, only rule two has the addition of a class selector. Going down the cascade, rule two
            has more specficity than rule one, therefore applying the font color red to the text. However, since no 
            declaration was made in rule two in regards to the background color, it will inherit the declaration 
            from rule one. In conclusion, we have a yellow background with a red text applied.    
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: Special symbols that are used for different selectors like the universal selector (*) or the 
            combinator symbols (+, ~, &gt;, and an empty space) do not add specificity.
            <pre>
                CSS
                <code>
                    /* rule 1 */
                    .class.second-class {
                        font-size: 12px;
                    }
            
                    /* rule 2 */
                    .class .second-class {
                        font-size: 24px;
                        }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            In this sample, we see that both use the same number of class selectors, and both are using the same 
            classes as well. Neither of the of the combinators add specificity and both affect the same declaration. 
            The results with the cascade giving priority to rule two because it is more recent (more below).
            <pre>
                CSS
                <code>
                    /* rule 1 */
                    .class.second-class {
                        font-size: 12px;
                    }
            
                    /* rule 2 */
                    .class > .second-class {
                        font-size: 24px;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            In this example, the same situation occurs. Both are using the same class selectors and the same 
            exact classes. The child combinator (&gt;) does not change specificity, so priority is given way to 
            rule two, applying a font fize of 24px.
            <pre>
                CSS
                <code>
                    /* rule 1 */
                    * {
                        color: black;
                    }
            
                    /* rule 2 */
                    h1 {
                        color: orange;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            In this scenario we a universal selector used and a type selector. Priority will be given to rule two 
            because rule one uses an universal selector that has no specificity value. The type selector &lt;h1&gt; 
            has a higher specificity value over the universal selector so our text color will be orange.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Inheritance
        </h2>
        <p>
            Inheritance are CSS properties that are inherited by a child element when applied to the parent 
            element. While typography-based properties are usually inherited, most other properties are not. This 
            rule passes except when directly applying properties directly to an element.
            <pre>
                HTML
                <code>
                    &lt;div id="parent"&gt;
                        &lt;div class="child"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <pre>
                CSS
                <code>
                    #parent {
                        color: red;
                    }
            
                    .child {
                        color: blue;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            In this situation, we see that we have an ID selector applying a red font color to the text and a class 
            selector applying a blue font color to the text. While the class &lt;child&gt; element inherits the red 
            font color property, that particular property only applies directly to the class &lt;parent&gt; element. 
            The class &lt;child&# will still apply a blue font color to its text because is more directed towards the 
            element itself and has higher specificity than an inherited property, even if it comes from a selector 
            with a higher specificity.
        </p>
        
        <h2>
            Rule Order
        </h2>
        <p>
            Lastly, the Rule Order is the final decision. If all other affecting factors have been taken into 
            account, and there are still conflicting properties clashing, then the last defined rule will come above.
            <pre>
                CSS
                <code>
                    .alert {
                        color: red;
                    }
            
                    .warning {
                        color: yellow;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            In this example, if we have a single element that has both the &lt;alert&gt; and &lt;warning&gt; classes, 
            the cascade will go through every other factor. This includes inherited properties (none), and specificity 
            (neither more than the other). We see that *ltwarning*gt was the last one to be defined and no other 
            factor could determine which rule was more prioritized or more specific, the element gets applied with 
            a yellow colored font.
